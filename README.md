> **"You are the Pilot, AI is the Co-pilot."**  
> Welcome to the repository for the **Data Analysis 2026** course at CHU. This course is designed to transform you from a coding novice to a data athlete through **High-Frequency Athletic Training**.

## 🏫 Course Philosophy: Athletic Training 🏋️‍♂️

We believe that coding is a physical skill that requires muscle memory.
*   **20 Labs/Week**: Just like doing reps in the gym.
*   **Visual Feedback**: We start with Turtle Graphics because if you can *see* your logic errors, you can fix them.
*   **AI-Assisted**: Learn to prompt, refactor, and architect with LLMs (Gemini/ChatGPT).
