> **"You are the Pilot, AI is the Co-pilot."**  
> Welcome to the repository for the **Data Analysis 2026** course at CHU. This course is designed to transform you from a coding novice to a data athlete through **High-Frequency Athletic Training**.

## 🏫 Course Philosophy: Athletic Training 🏋️‍♂️

We believe that coding is a physical skill that requires muscle memory.
*   **20 Labs/Week**: Just like doing reps in the gym.
*   **Visual Feedback**: We start with Turtle Graphics because if you can *see* your logic errors, you can fix them.
*   **AI-Assisted**: Learn to prompt, refactor, and architect with LLMs (Gemini/ChatGPT).

## 🌏 EMI Support Strategy (Bilingual Bridge)

This course uses the **"Keyword Sandwich"** method for non-native English speakers:
*   **English**: All Code, Technical Terms, Error Messages.
*   **Chinese**: Context, "Why", and Deep Logic explanations.
